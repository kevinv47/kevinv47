    "text": "Peso Crisis (1994 - 1996)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Banco de México\nThe Mexican Peso Crisis involved a dramatic devaluation of the Mexican peso, which fell from 3 pesos per USD to 6 pesos per USD, effectively losing half its value. Before the crisis, Mexico had attempted to maintain a peg to the USD, allowing the peso to fluctuate within a specific range. However, this seemingly stable peg collapsed in December when the government finally allowed the peso to devalue, triggering a series of economic and political challenges. Below, we will explore some of the most significant political and economic factors during this period.\n\nAssasinaitons & A Violent Mobilization\nNumerous destabilizing events occurred in 1994. I particularly appreciate the title of the El País article, “México 1994: el año que pasó todo” (“The Year Everything Happened”). For brevity, I will focus on two key political factors that stressed the exchange rate and contributed to the December crisis: high-profile political assassinations and the eruption of the Zapatista movement.\nFirst, to understand the assassinations and their impact, some context is necessary. Mexico’s dominant political party, the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party), had controlled the country since the 1930s, effectively creating a one-party system. However, by the 1990s, the PRI’s grip on power was weakening, culminating in the election of the first non-PRI president in 2000. \nPhoto by Infobae\nAt the time, sitting presidents selected their successors to run as the PRI’s presidential candidate. Luis Donaldo Colosio, chosen by President Salinas de Gortari, was widely expected to reform the party from within. However, on March 23, Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana, triggering a chaotic scramble to find a replacement just months before the election.\nThis process was complicated by the Mexican Constitution, which prohibits individuals holding high office within the previous six months from running for president. Despite this, Ernesto Zedillo was selected as the new PRI candidate and later oversaw the peso devaluation in December.\nThe instability deepened when, on September 28, José Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the PRI’s general secretary—a position wielding significant influence over the party and national politics—was also assassinated.\nWhile neither Colosio nor Ruiz Massieu held active government roles at the time, their positions at the helm of the PRI were crucial. These events shook confidence in a party already under pressure from increasingly competitive smaller parties.\nStable political regimes are essential for fostering predictable economic environments. For decades, the PRI had artificially maintained political stability, but by 1994, this stability was unraveling. The assassinations signaled threats to political order, unsettling markets. Although the PRI sought to reassure markets by swiftly transitioning to a new presidential candidate, this effort added pressure to an already fragile system, setting the stage for the December economic crisis.\nPhoto by Eduardo Verdugo for The AP\nSecond, it is crucial to note that NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) came into effect on January 1, 1994. This agreement brought great optimism about Mexico’s economic potential, encouraging investors to view the country as a promising destination for economic activity. This renewed attention increased demand for the peso.\nHowever, on the same day, January 1, 1994, the Zapatista movement emerged on the national stage. Composed primarily of indigenous militias from Chiapas, the movement opposed the government’s economic liberalization policies, including NAFTA, which they believed marginalized their communities and threatened their traditional way of life. This resistance raised concerns about the stability of Mexico’s economic trajectory.\nThe Zapatista uprising involved violent confrontations, with over a hundred fatalities in the initial clashes, casting doubt in investors’ minds about Mexico’s ability to sustain economic growth without significant disruption. The government faced pressure to crack down on the movement, which it did, but this heavy-handed response underscored the resistance to investor-friendly reforms.\nThis opposition to economic liberalization, coupled with violence and unrest, created uncertainty about the viability of Mexico’s economic policies. It also increased pressure on the peso peg, a cornerstone of the government’s economic strategy, contributing to the strain that ultimately led to the December crisis.\n\n\nThe Tesobonos and Economic Factors\nTo understand the Peso Crisis, one key factor is the role of tesobonos. These were short-term bonds with a fixed exchange rate, payable in USD. They offered investors the dual benefit of currency stability and higher interest rates than U.S. bonds. By linking returns to USD, the Mexican government aimed to attract foreign investors and inspire confidence amid political instability. At the same time, this strategy aligned with Mexico’s economic goals under NAFTA and its push for more open trade policies.\nWith the peso pegged to the U.S. dollar, it became overvalued over time, making trade more expensive and requiring increasingly large amounts of foreign reserves to maintain the peg. The loss of the peg, or the solution that was eventually used—allowing the peso to float freely against the dollar—was necessary to ease the pressure on imports and the central bank. However, since it was an election year, and with growing political competition, the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) wanted to avoid changing the currency until after the elections. Once Ernesto Zedillo took office, he faced mounting pressure from the peso’s overvaluation and finally allowed the peso to float. This decision, however, led to a sharp depreciation of the peso, as investors panicked and sold off their holdings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: The World Bank\nIt’s important to remember the nature of tesobonos, which were government-issued debt instruments with a fixed exchange rate and were promised to be paid out in U.S. dollars. As the value of the debt exceeded the value of Mexico’s foreign reserves, investors began to worry about Mexico’s ability to repay the loans. The graph above illustrates the dramatic decline in the ratio of Mexico’s total reserves to foreign debt. As a result, investors began to offload their Mexican assets, contributing to the peso losing half of its value.\nThe government needed to allow the peso to depreciate to ease pressure on foreign reserves and make Mexican exports more competitive, which could help address the current account deficit. However, the Zedillo administration could not reassure investors that it could sustain the peso’s depreciation due to the structure of tesobonos, whose value could exceed Mexico’s foreign reserves, risking default. This loss of investor confidence further devalued the peso and raised doubts about Mexico’s ability to meet its obligations."

    "text": "Economic Slowdown & Trump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Banco de México\nBetween mid-2014 and early 2017, the peso experienced a steady devaluation against the USD, starting at around 13 pesos per US dollar and ending at 20 pesos. This represented a devaluation of 53.9%. Several factors contributed to this decline, both economic, such as fluctuations in gas prices, and political, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the victory of Donald Trump. In this discussion, we will explore some of the key factors behind this devaluation.\n\nOil Prices & Economic Uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Statista\nOil prices have been rising dramatically since the turn of the century, as evidenced by OPEC oil prices. The only significant dip occurred during the Great Recession, but prices quickly recovered, reaching new heights in 2012, when the average annual cost of a barrel of oil exceeded $109. However, just four years later, the price plummeted to less than $41, resulting in a loss of more than half its value.\nWhat does this means for Mexico, who has very large oil and gas sectors? The oil indiustry in Mexico in nationalieze by the government adn serves as government revenue.It meant an unprecedtned plumment that would devalue a great part of Mexico’s GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Statista"

I particularly appreciate the title of the El País article, “México 1994: el año que pasó todo” (“The Year Everything Happened”). For brevity, I will focus on two key political factors that stressed the exchange rate and contributed to the December crisis: high-profile political assassinations and the eruption of the Zapatista movement.\nFirst, to understand the assassinations and their impact, some context is necessary. Mexico’s dominant political party, the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party), had controlled the country since the 1930s, effectively creating a one-party system. However, by the 1990s, the PRI’s grip on power was weakening, culminating in the election of the first non-PRI president in 2000. \nPhoto by Infobae\nAt the time, sitting presidents selected their successors to run as the PRI’s presidential candidate. Luis Donaldo Colosio, chosen by President Salinas de Gortari, was widely expected to reform the party from within. However, on March 23, Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana, triggering a chaotic scramble to find a replacement just months before the election.\nThis process was complicated by the Mexican Constitution, which prohibits individuals holding high office within the previous six months from running for president. Despite this, Ernesto Zedillo was selected as the new PRI candidate and later oversaw the peso devaluation in December.\nThe instability deepened when, on September 28, José Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the PRI’s general secretary—a position wielding significant influence over the party and national politics—was also assassinated.\nWhile neither Colosio nor Ruiz Massieu held active government roles at the time, their positions at the helm of the PRI were crucial. These events shook confidence in a party already under pressure from increasingly competitive smaller parties.\nStable political regimes are essential for fostering predictable economic environments. For decades, the PRI had artificially maintained political stability, but by 1994, this stability was unraveling. The assassinations signaled threats to political order, unsettling markets. Although the PRI sought to reassure markets by swiftly transitioning to a new presidential candidate, this effort added pressure to an already fragile system, setting the stage for the December economic crisis.\nPhoto by Eduardo Verdugo for The AP\nSecond, it is crucial to note that NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) came into effect on January 1, 1994. This agreement brought great optimism about Mexico’s economic potential, encouraging investors to view the country as a promising destination for economic activity. This renewed attention increased demand for the peso.\nHowever, on the same day, January 1, 1994, the Zapatista movement emerged on the national stage. Composed primarily of indigenous militias from Chiapas, the movement opposed the government’s economic liberalization policies, including NAFTA, which they believed marginalized their communities and threatened their traditional way of life. This resistance raised concerns about the stability of Mexico’s economic trajectory.\nThe Zapatista uprising involved violent confrontations, with over a hundred fatalities in the initial clashes, casting doubt in investors’ minds about Mexico’s ability to sustain economic growth without significant disruption. The government faced pressure to crack down on the movement, which it did, but this heavy-handed response underscored the resistance to investor-friendly reforms.\nThis opposition to economic liberalization, coupled with violence and unrest, created uncertainty about the viability of Mexico’s economic policies. It also increased pressure on the peso peg, a cornerstone of the government’s economic strategy, contributing to the strain that ultimately led to the December crisis."

By linking returns to USD, the Mexican government aimed to attract foreign investors and inspire confidence amid political instability. At the same time, this strategy aligned with Mexico’s economic goals under NAFTA and its push for more open trade policies.\nWith the peso pegged to the U.S. dollar, it became overvalued over time, making trade more expensive and requiring increasingly large amounts of foreign reserves to maintain the peg. The loss of the peg, or the solution that was eventually used—allowing the peso to float freely against the dollar—was necessary to ease the pressure on imports and the central bank.

This sharp drop significantly impacted federal government revenue, as oil-related income made up 30% of the federal budget in 2016. Such a decline created ripple effects across the economy, raising concerns among investors about the stability and potential risks of investing in the Mexican economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, as seen in GDP during this period, the Mexican economy was in decline, which can help explain the peso’s depreciation during this time. The decline of the Mexican economy reflects poorly on investor confidence and could result in fewer investment opportunities, leading to reduced demand for Mexican financial assets. This contributed to the steady depreciation of the peso against the USD that we observed.\n\nTrump\nPhoto by Saul Loeb in CNN\nEntering 2015, a new wave of political tension emerged as Donald Trump’s rhetoric toward Mexico gained traction in the United States. This hostility, coupled with the progressive economic decline leading up to the U.S. elections and Trump’s inauguration, heightened investor concerns about the future of Mexican assets. Trump’s vocal criticism of NAFTA and calls for its renegotiation added further uncertainty. Until the renegotiation was completed, markets remained unsure of Mexico’s economic prospects. Overall, the instability during the early Trump administration exacerbated these challenges, contributing to the depreciation of the peso and increasing economic uncertainty."

Maroon represents the coalition dominated by Morena, “Sigamos Haciendo Historia,” while orange represents the Movimiento Naranja party, and pink represents Fuerza y Corazón por México, a coalition of institutional parties in Mexico.\nThe remarkable achievement of securing more than two-thirds of the congressional seats means this bloc has the power to amend the constitution without needing cooperation from opposing parties in the Chamber of Deputies and requires only two votes in the Senate. Not to mention MORENA candidate Claudia Sheinbaum becoming the first woman president this year. Controversial reforms, such as those proposed by former President AMLO—like restructuring the body in charge of elections—and reforms already implemented, such as allowing judges to be elected, are among the proposals seen as threats to democracy. These developments have made investors wary of Mexican assets.\nPhoto by Fernando Llano for the AP\nIn the lead-up to the elections, there was also a record-breaking amount of homicides of political candidates, which did not help the appearance of stability in Mexican democracy. This, along with the dominance that MORENA has secured at the federal level, caused concern among investors about the future of democracy in Mexico.\nFinally, there are also the 2024 U.S. presidential elections, which saw the victory of Republicans gaining a majority in the House and the Senate, with Donald Trump as president. The peso is not likely to respond well to this in the coming weeks, and we are only beginning to see some of the rhetoric that may affect the value of Mexican assets, potentially depreciating the peso. President-elect Donald Trump, for example, has said that he wants to add a 25% tariff on Mexican imports, to which President Claudia Sheinbaum said, ‘For every tariff, there will be a response in kind.’\nThe duration of the current depreciation of the peso remains uncertain, as the Trump administration won’t begin implementing its policies for several months. In the meantime, the policies that MORENA adopts in the coming months will likely also have a significant impact on reassuring investors that democracy is not at risk in Mexico."

The only thing the teacher did was smoke, read magazines, and gossip with teachers who happened to pass by in the halls. To keep students busy, she would tell them to write letters or numbers repeatedly on a page. She never taught from a book or gave a lecture. When the school year ended, my grandmother thought my mom would have to repeat the year because my mom didn’t know how to read. My grandmother spoke with the second-grade teacher to ask about my mom repeating the first year given she had not learned anything. The teacher reassured her that all the students were in the same place. The second-grade teacher said she would teach first grade the first semester and second grade the second. My mom remembers that she was an excellent teacher who taught them to start reading in about three months. The second-grade teacher taught a group of fifty students two years’ worth of content in one year. This is what led me to investigate the systemic educational disparities in the Mexican education system, specifically in public primary and secondary schools."

    "section": "Outcomes and Statistics",
    "text": "Outcomes and Statistics\nAccording to the OECD’s (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) figures, compared to member countries’ academic student performance through the results of the OECD-administered PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) test, Mexico ranks poorly in most educational outcomes and statistics compared to other member states. Among all the OECD countries, Mexico consistently ranks as one of the lowest-performing countries, such that it is easier to list these statistical comparisons by how far away Mexico is from last place. In the 2018 OECD report, it ranks fourth to last among forty countries in reading (2021e), fifth to last in mathematics, (2021d) and fifth to last in science, 2021f). In spending, a similar story is also provided by the OECD’s report. Mexico ranks third to last in spending per student and seventh to last in percent of GDP spent on public education (OECD, 2021c). While on the other hand, it is the sixth-highest spender in percent GDP spent on private education (OECD, 2021b). This indicates there is rampant inequality in education, as the public schools where poorer individuals attend are one of the worst-funded in the developed world, while private schools where more affluent students attend are the best-funded in the world. However, spending does not always equate to quality of education. This can be seen with Costa Rica, which spends more than double per student ($15,876 to Mexico’s $7,341) (OECD, 2021a). It places behind Mexico in mathematics and science, and only one place ahead in reading (OECD, 2021d&e). Although the amount spent is important, how it is spent is more influential in the quality of education. With a questionable education system and difficult job market, the so-called ninis (those who neither are in school or working) are high in quantity in Mexico. The 2021 OECD report shows Mexico above average in percent of ninis, with fifteen to nineteen year old men being at 10% and women of the same age being at around 19% (OECD, 2021h). All of these indicators have pointed to an education system that is failing the Mexican people. SNTE This section will focus on how teacher unions, namely the SNTE (Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación) with 1,673,623 members (Redacción UNIÓN, 2018), function in the Mexican education system. I will draw from an analysis by a professor of education at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Carlos Ornelas, on the corporatist structures of the SNTE, as well as a brief history. Then, I will delineate how the SNTE controls the vital apparatuses of education in practice and examine other powers of the SNTE from my interview with Professor Norma Vélez, the upper secondary school principal at the Universidad Cuauhtémoc Guadalajara. Britannica defines corporatism as the “theory and practice of organizing the whole of society into corporate entities subordinate to the state” (Corporatism, 2014). Practiced in fascist authoritarian regimes like the infamous Nazi Germany and Mussolini’s Italy, a corporatist regime creates institutions or organizations that categorize people under the power of an organ. The corporatist ideology in Latin America harkens back to the colonialist era which also practiced a similar dynamic of the mother country creating puppet institutions overseas. These corporatist structures are given a monopolistic authority over the representation of those under the organs’ jurisdiction. The organs are subordinate to the regime and act for it by following its orders and suppressing the dissenting opinions of its constituents. In return, the state can grant certain privileges to the constituents of the corporatist organ in exchange for more privileges to the oligarchical council that leads the organ and minimal supervision of the organ operations. The corporatist ideology is the foundation from which the SNTE was structured and contextualizes all of its interactions. SNTE History By understanding the corporatist ideology that created the SNTE, the SNTE’s history can be seen to be a complicated evolution of an interplay between the regime and a power-hungry organ. During the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas in the late 1930s, corporatist structures began to be erected out of unions. President Cárdenas consolidated many problematic and important unions like farmers, industrial workers, and other sectors into a national union with oligarchical leaders appointed by the one-party state. Approximately 700 different teachers were able to fend off pressure to consolidate until 1944, when President Ávila Camacho signed an executive order to force the unions to become the SNTE (Ornelas, 2008, p. 450). Public school teachers were obliged to be part of the union which bestowed upon the leaders of the SNTE a monopoly on the representation of educators, as they were the only legitimate interlocutor with the state on education. Until the 1970s, there was a lack of oversight of SNTE operations, which catalyzed the process of what Ornelas describes as the SNTE colonization of the SEP (Secretaría de Educación Pública), the Mexican department of education. SEP was a federally centralized organization and the leaders who partnered with the SNTE had the support of the major monopoly of education advocacy which allowed these leaders to be successful in the SEP. Before long, the SEP and SNTE had become close partners in its leadership which expanded the SNTE’s influence further (Ornelas, 2008, Colonización y contienda). The presidencies of Echeverria, Lopez Portillo, and Miguel de Madrid in the 1970s and early 1980s seemed to weaken the increasingly autonomous SNTE’s influence on the SEP. A decentralized SEP would be more difficult to control than a highly centralized SEP with a small congregation of people; this was an outrage for the SNTE (Ornelas, 2008, pp. 454-5). The presidency of Salinas de Gortari brought many changes to the regime and SNTE relations. In 1989, he kicked out the SNTE leader Carlos Jonguitud Barrios, a PRI member who was accused of corruption in his fifteen years as SNTE leader, to realign the SNTE with the regime (Ornelas, 2008, p. 455). He replaced him with another PRI member, the now infamous Elba Esther Gordillo (first in Forbes 10 Most Corrupt Mexican of 2013). Gordillo would be in power for twenty-four years and would oversee numerous changes to the way the SNTE would work with the regime. In 1992, Gordillo conceded to the Acuerdo par la modernization de Educación Básica, which would apply federalism to the SNTE organization in exchange for benefits for teachers and more political authority in the system. Morelos also explained that it had implicit agreements as well, the continuation of colonization of the SEP with the firing of the SEP leader Barlett Díaz who impeded the SNTE’s colonization efforts (Ornelas, 2008, p. 456). Until the PAN President, Vicente Fox, in 2000, the PRI had been the dominant figure in the federal government and exclusively in the executive. It was a complicated question whether the SNTE, as a corporatist structure, would continue to function by allying with different political parties. The answer was yes. According to Ornelas, the SNTE was a convenient tool for the PAN to use as newcomers to controlling the executive branch. Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderon were close allies with Gordillo as they lacked oversight of the SNTE and in exchange, Gordillo helped them with support for his legitimacy and policies that would look good for the public like the 2002 Compromiso Social por la Calidad de la Educación which declared that each educational actor should do their part (Ornelas, 2008, La Verdadera Nueva Alianza). This period secured the SNTE as not necessarily a PRI organ but an organ that can be used by any political leader who wishes to play the game, allowing the SNTE to operate in exchange for their political help. Although the PRI had created the SNTE as a corporatist organ for its regime after the PAN years, the SNTE has grown in sufficient autonomy that it can switch parties to ally with or across parties. With the return to PRI presidents in 2012, President Peña tried to undercut many of the freedom and lack of oversight of the SNTE with teacher exams for incompetent teachers but failed to pass the reforms after the teacher union protest (Usi, 2019). With the 2018 election of the MORENA president Lopez Obrador there was again a return to the pleasing of the SNTE with the abolition of the INEE (Instituto Nacional para la Evaluación de la Educación that independently evaluated school performances) and also did not create teacher exams that could identify the worst teachers. SNTE Power Dynamics After this brief history that contextualizes the SNTE, we can now examine how it has influenced policy-making in Mexico. In Congress, the committee on education CDE (Comisión de Educación), in both the chamber of deputies and the senate, is in charge of educational policy by acting as the “gatekeepers’’ to passing initiatives (Santibáñez, 2008, p. 427). Therefore this committee has the power to push forward or stall different educational initiatives, which means control of it is influential for the rest of the educational apparatuses. In three out of four legislative terms from 1997 to 2009, 50% of the CDE mesa directiva (committee leaders) in the chamber of deputies had an affiliation with the SNTE (Figure 1). There is a notable influence on the CDE from the SNTE that leads to further expansion of the SNTE power of the educational apparatuses. The budget committee also influences the education budget, which is why SNTE has seen it as imperative to control it. From 2006 to 2009, the Senate CDE was led by SNTE leader, Gordillo’s daughter, Mónica Tzasna Arriola Gordillo, as one of the directors of the committee. As a consequence of their immense power, real teacher salaries in Mexico increased between 34-40% in Mexico between 1996 and 2004, which is the second highest teacher salary increase among OECD members behind Hungary (Santibáñez, 2008, 421). These wage gains return to the SNTE with union dues that prop up the union financially. This has allowed the SNTE to pocket some of the money, as was shown by the corruption charges filed against Gordillo that accused her of embezzling $200 million dollars (Estevez, 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChamber\nLegislature\n\n\nLVII (%)\n1997-2000\nLVIII (%)\n2000-2003\nLVIX (%)\n2003-2006\nLVX (%)\n2006-2009\n\n\n\n\nChamber of Deputies\n\n\nMesa directiva (directors of CDE) affiliated with SNTE\n2 (50)\n4 (80)\n3 (43)\n7 (58)\n\n\nAll CDE members affiliated with SNTE (including mesa directiva)\n10 (38)\n8 (36)\n6 (26)\n12 (40)\n\n\nSenate\n\n\nMesa directiva (directors of CDE) affiliated with SNTE\n2 (50)\n0 (0)\n1 (33)\n1 (33)\n\n\nAll CDE members affiliated with SNTE (including mesa directiva)\n3 (23)\n2 (17)\n1 (8)\n2 (28)"

Adapted translated version of Lucrecia Santibáñez Figure 1 in her 2008 investigation Reforma Educativa: El Papel del SNTE (Santibáñez, 2008, p. 428). The following is a translation of Santibáñez notes: A person is considered a member of the SNTE when: their profile indicates they are an active member of the SNTE, when they hold or have held an administrative position in the CEN of the SNTE or in the sectional committees. In the event the CVs are not detailed, it is assumed the person is active in the SNTE, when they have served as a supervisor or director of basic education schools, have held an administrative position (e.g. director or academic secretary) of a normal school or the UPN or when its only reference is that it lists basic education teacher as an occupation. Source: Own elaboration based on the curricula vitae of deputies, provided by the Education Commission of the Chamber of Deputies and information contained in who is who in Congress (Mexico, 1999). For the LIX Legislature, information was used from www.monitorlegislativo.org.\nThe SNTE has an explicit goal to lobby for teacher benefits, and its implicit goal is to prop its oligarchs and friends up with a vast hold of educational apparatuses. They carry out their goal by creating close alliances and revolving doors between themselves, educational policymakers, and SEP leaders, according to my interview with Professor Velez (N. Velez, personal communication, November 30, 2022). They have vast control over the educational system with no intention to support the educational opposite. Even a 2006 poll showed 41% of basic (elementary) school teachers say the SNTE helps teachers but does little to advance educational quality. However, I argue that because the SNTE has both massive control over educational apparatuses and no obligation to educational quality, the SNTE is at best a roadblock to educational quality and at worst actively working against it to avoid needing to worry about educational quality. Strikes have become a political tool for SNTE goals as well, which have come at the expense of educational quality. Santibañez discusses the SNTE Section 22 strike in Oaxaca in 2006 which exemplifies the strikes as a political weapon (2008, p. 423). Teachers went on strike for better wages, but even after this plea was granted, the strike continued as a means for initiating the resignation of the governor of Oaxaca. The strike lasted for more than five months and meant students lost almost an entire semester. SNTE has immense power in the educational system, which they are willing to use for political gain at the expense of educational quality. In my research, there were holes regarding specific SNTE operations, so to understand more explicit and implicit powers of the SNTE, I interviewed Professor Norma Vélez, the upper secondary school principal at the Universidad Cuauhtémoc Guadalajara, who has twenty years of experience in education, including sixteen years as a principal. To become a public school teacher, candidates must join the union first. The SNTE administers the examen de oposición (qualification test) to the candidates and then selects teachers. Professor Velez explains it is an open secret that prospective teachers with friends in the SNTE or with a bribe, can pass the test, as the SNTE has no real incentive to quality education (N. Velez, personal communication, November 30, 2022). A form where this dynamic has worked is in the French department of education, which operates under a similarly centralized system that hires teachers at a national level and then “appoints” them to particular schools. It would be understandable for the department of education to have control of these appointments because a department of education, like in the France example, has an obligation to better education (Cornu, 2015, p. 290).The SNTE does not have oversight or an incentive to promote quality education, which is why it is unreasonable for the SNTE to have the power to create and administer a qualification test and send teachers to schools. Desirable teacher appointments–those close to home or in urban areas–are those most likely to be given to teachers with friends in the SNTE or with a bribe while undesirable teacher appoints–those in rural–poor, or dangerous areas are many times given to good teachers without these friends who go to these schools only to be burned out. Schools then feel that they do not have control of who their teachers are as seen in Figure 2."

The only thing the teacher did was smoke, read magazines, and gossip with teachers who happened to pass by in the halls. To keep students busy, she would tell them to write letters or numbers repeatedly on a page. She never taught from a book or gave a lecture. When the school year ended, my grandmother thought my mom would have to repeat the year because my mom didn’t know how to read. My grandmother spoke with the second-grade teacher to ask about my mom repeating the first year given she had not learned anything. The teacher reassured her that all the students were in the same place. The second-grade teacher said she would teach first grade the first semester and second grade the second. My mom remembers that she was an excellent teacher who taught them to start reading in about three months. The second-grade teacher taught a group of fifty students two years’ worth of content in one year. This is what led me to investigate the systemic educational disparities in the Mexican education system, specifically in public primary and secondary schools."

Santibañez discusses the SNTE Section 22 strike in Oaxaca in 2006 which exemplifies the strikes as a political weapon (2008, p. 423). Teachers went on strike for better wages, but even after this plea was granted, the strike continued as a means for initiating the resignation of the governor of Oaxaca. The strike lasted for more than five months and meant students lost almost an entire semester. SNTE has immense power in the educational system, which they are willing to use for political gain at the expense of educational quality. In my research, there were holes regarding specific SNTE operations, so to understand more explicit and implicit powers of the SNTE, I interviewed Professor Norma Vélez, the upper secondary school principal at the Universidad Cuauhtémoc Guadalajara, who has twenty years of experience in education, including sixteen years as a principal. To become a public school teacher, candidates must join the union first. The SNTE administers the examen de oposición (qualification test) to the candidates and then selects teachers. Professor Velez explains it is an open secret that prospective teachers with friends in the SNTE or with a bribe, can pass the test, as the SNTE has no real incentive to quality education (N. Velez, personal communication, November 30, 2022). A form where this dynamic has worked is in the French department of education, which operates under a similarly centralized system that hires teachers at a national level and then “appoints” them to particular schools. It would be understandable for the department of education to have control of these appointments because a department of education, like in the France example, has an obligation to better education (Cornu, 2015, p. 290).The SNTE does not have oversight or an incentive to promote quality education, which is why it is unreasonable for the SNTE to have the power to create and administer a qualification test and send teachers to schools. Desirable teacher appointments–those close to home or in urban areas–are those most likely to be given to teachers with friends in the SNTE or with a bribe while undesirable teacher appoints–those in rural–poor, or dangerous areas are many times given to good teachers without these friends who go to these schools only to be burned out. Schools then feel that they do not have control of who their teachers are as seen in Figure 2.\nFigure 2\nSchools that Reported Considerable Autonomy Over Different factors of Teacher Selection (2007-2008)  Note. This figure was taken from Figure 2.4 in the 2007-2008 OECD TALIS database (OECD, 2009, p. 37). They noted: “Countries are ranked in descending order of the percentage of teachers whose principal reported considerable responsibility held at the school for selecting teachers for hire” (OECD, 2009, p. 37).\nProfessor Velez also explains that the contracts teachers have once they are appointed to a school are also administered by the SNTE. They are the ones that renew the plazas (contracts), which have also been scrutinized for corruption. A 2002 pool of elementary and middle school teachers even said that a third of teachers think that the venta de plazas (bribes to get contracts) is a frequent practice (Santibañez, 2008, p. 422). The lack of non-SNTE filters for candidates to become teachers and the lack of consequences for incompetent or corrupt teachers means that the credentials and abilities of teachers can not be trusted. This lack of credentials and competence manifests in Figure 3 which shows that Mexico ranks high in principles considering their teachers’ behavior hinders education quality. This lack of trust can explain why Mexico ranks very low in teachers having responsibility for school policies and curriculum (Figure 4). School leaders do not trust teachers with choosing what can be taught and other important policies which can limit and burn out passionate teachers who are competent. Another corrupt practice with teacher contracts is the licenses that the SNTE can advocate for on behalf of the teacher. These licenses are paid leaves of absence that can be manipulated to help certain teachers neglect their school responsibilities. This is why Professor Velez has anecdotally heard of teachers with friends in the SNTE getting away with teaching only a few times a year (N. Velez, personal communication, November 30, 2022).\nFigure 3\nPercentage of Teachers Whose Schools Principals Reported That the Following Teacher Behaviors Hindered the Provision of Instruction in Their School a Lot or to Some Extent (2007-2008)  Note. This figure was taken from Figure 2.5 in the 2007-2008 OECD TALIS database (OECD, 2009, p. 39). The following is their note on the figure: “Countries are ranked in descending order of the percentage of teachers whose school principal reported a lack of pedagogical preparation as a factor hindering instruction” (OECD, 2009, p. 39). This high-ranking Mexico has shown that the lack of oversight of the SNTE from authorities with in interest in educational quality is translating to more incompetent teachers who lower educational quality.\nFigure 4\nOverall Teachers’ Responsibilities for School Policies, Curriculum and Instruction  Note. This figure was taken from Figure 15 in the 2018 OECD TALIS (Teaching and Learning International Survey) database (OECD, 2019). The following is their note on the figure: “1.This percentage is calculated based on whether principals report that teachers have significant responsibility in at least 4 of the following 6 tasks:”establishing student disciplinary policies and procedures”; “approving students for admission to the school”; “establishing student assessment policies”; “choosing which learning materials are used”; “deciding which courses are offered” and “determining course content”. Countries and economies are ranked in descending order of the percentage of lower secondary principals who report that teachers have significant responsibility in a majority of tasks related to school policies, curriculum, and instruction”(OECD, 2019).\nThe SNTE was founded to have a corporatist relationship with the state and this relationship has continued out of conveniences, incentives, and optics, although the relationship has become more complicated over time. The SNTE was made to have a monopoly on the representation of educators and lack of oversight in exchange for its support to political friends. This lack of oversight, however, has led the SNTE to expand its reach to guarantee its power at the expense of educational quality."

    "text": "SEP Structures\nTo understand how the corruption of the SEP is undoubtedly negatively affecting the quality of education in Mexico, I will start by examining its structure. Created in 1921, the SEP was created to also be a corporatist organ that has largely continued to be under the thumb of the executive, unlike the SNTE which has increased in autonomy and leverage over time. The SEP has been described to have four types of employees: regular employees, empleados de base, empleados de confianza, and those with plaza de contrato (Scott et al., 2018, p.47). Regular employees are the smallest category and normal straightforward legal employment and perform smaller not as important tasks. Empleados de base (base employees) are underwritten by the SNTE and cannot be moved from their positions to the point that if they retire family members, their position will be inherited or sold. With every change of the minister (head) of the SEP new empleados de confianza (employees of confidence) are brought in and the minister can replace them if they fail to conform or with the changing of the minister by the president. Those with plazas de contrato (contracts), “in areas like graphic design and computer science, who alone among the employees were sometimes chosen for their expertise and not their political loyalty” (Scott et al., 2018, p.47). In this system all those with the power to make a change need to answer to a superior or their “sponsor” into the system meaning that, “loyalty to group was paramount and more important than trying to find solutions to educational problems” (Scott et al., 2018, p.48). These roles show that the SEP corporatist and loyalty employment structures create a system with incentives to please superiors or a “sponsor,” not to do what is right for the education system."

    "section": "SEP Power Dynamics",
    "text": "SEP Power Dynamics\nAfter seeing the structures in the SEP that enable corruption, the examples of SEP corruption in practice affecting educational quality can now be visited. One recurring fact is that the president of Mexico has historically, and continually, used the SEP as an easy way to disperse propaganda throughout the nation. The program Libros de Texto Gratuitos (free textbooks) for example, is mandatory and was part of the 1992 Salinas and Zedillo textbook scandal (Gilbert, 1997, p.271). It was an attempt for President Salinas–who helped Gordillo into the SNTE–and Minister of SEP Ernesto Zedillo (future president) to create new textbooks that would sanitize Mexican history (Gilbert, 1997, Zapata and the Revolution). NAFTA was a hallmark of President Salinas de Gortari’s administration, and he would use more than one channel to tell the Mexican people that it was a good idea. The 1992 texts pushed forward by President Salinas and the SEP were criticized for, “rewriting national history with the intention of pandering to U.S. opinion and undermining traditional Mexican nationalism” (Gilbert, 1997, p.284). The focus of the political figures that operate the SEP is not quality education, but seeing how their powers can help them win politically. The priorities of those who run the SEP are not promoting quality education and this corruption undoubtedly undermines it.\nThe Mexican education system has historically had the intention to promote assimilation and nationalism for rural, indigenous, and poorer people who were more prone to anti-government radicalism (Corona, 2008). The 1946 reform to Article III of the Mexican constitution, which guarantees education for Mexicans, states that the schools should foment in students “amor a patria”(love for country) (Diario Oficial, 1946). In other words, the school should be a place for the diffusion of pro-government propaganda which led to the SEP free textbooks program. The program has a complex history, especially for the various indigenous languages. Corona examined the different government initiatives and programs for the education of indigenous people over time and concluded that there is no variation contained in such governmental proposals, and it is clear that there is no interest in strengthening or learning about the indigenous culture itself” (2008, Abstract). It shows that the objective of assimilation trumps creating educational initiatives of quality through respect for indigenous culture.\nAnother example of political figures exerting their power through the SEP is using the SEP to win votes or smear opponents. Professor Velez recounts that she attended a mandatory SEP professional development event for principals of schools. However, this training session was really a way for the SEP to tell the principals that they should vote against President AMLO (Andrés Manuel López Obrador) in the recall referendum and that they should also let their teachers and students know that they should do the same. She explains that the governor of Jalisco is politically against the president’s party, so he used the SEP to create training sessions as an excuse to spread his propaganda. Instead of the SEP helping principals with training on how to be better leaders for their schools, which could better the quality of education, the SEP does what it is meant to do, which is be used by their political superiors. This SEP is manipulated at the state level by the state government but also at the federal level. Professor Velez explains that with every change in the presidential administration, there is an overhaul of teaching materials as each government wants to emphasize that their administration will do what the previous could not. She explains that the illusion of improvement of educational quality is valued over actual improvement, which would be a stable pedagogical method that teachers and students could get used to (N. Velez, personal communication, November 30, 2022).\nThe methods of evaluation have also been highly politicized as they are the windows into understanding the deficiencies of the system and the regime has a vested interest in making their administration look good. In 2021 Mexico suspended its participation in the PISA test (in this research paper the PISA test was the basis for identifying that a deficiency did exist but this test will not be able to provide this context in the future). It comes in a pattern of suspensions in the AMLO presidency with the pulling out of UNESCO’s ERCE test in and the abolition of the INEE (Instituto Nacional para la Evaluación Educativa), an autonomous government organ that performed regular tests in Mexico. The only test that remains is PLANEA (Plan Nacional para la Evaluación de los Aprendizajes) which was recently created in 2015 and is controlled by the SEP and administered by each school. By removing all tests except those under the jurisdiction of the SEP, the president can have control over these tests through the SEP. Professor Velez explains that because the results of the PLANEA test become public for each school, schools have an incentive to “help” their students by teaching the test to students beforehand (N. Velez, personal communication, November 30, 2022).\nIn these examples the SEP’s power over “curriculum, pedagogy, and eventually evaluation” is used by the regime for personal gain at the expense of meaningful improvements to quality education (Scott et al., 2018, p. 44)."

The brief identifies three ulterior motives behind AMLO’s reforms. Firstly, AMLO’s ideological tendencies underpin these reforms, characterized by a belief in representing the ‘pure’ will of the Mexican people against ‘corruptible’ establishment elites, aiming to replace existing institutions with his interpretation of popular will. Secondly, it highlights AMLO’s pursuit of heightened presidential authority, evident in attempts to curtail the autonomy of electoral institutions and establish greater executive control over electoral arbitrators. Thirdly, the reforms serve to expand AMLO’s newly dominant political party, MORENA, by granting advantages to incumbents through expanded propaganda definitions and leveraging dissatisfaction with the weakened state to perpetuate their dominance.\nThis brief will go on to provide a background of the issue, an in-depth elaboration of AMLO’s three ulterior motivations, and a brief implications section."

    "section": "(1) Part of a Rise in Anti-Democratic Rhetoric",
    "text": "(1) Part of a Rise in Anti-Democratic Rhetoric\nThe main driver of the reforms for AMLO was his personal and ideological animosity towards the INE. The reforms’ intention ties directly to AMLO’s rise to power and his beliefs. Starting political life during the PRI’s dominance in the 1970s, AMLO later aligned with the left-wing PRD. His prominence grew within the PRD after becoming Mexico City’s head of government in 2000. Narrowly losing the 2006 presidency bid to Felipe Calderon, AMLO alleged election fraud, sparking large protests. AMLO continues to attest that he in fact won the 2006 election and that the electoral institutions rigged the election (Sánchez-Talanquer and Greene 2021). Again in 2012, he lost to Enrique Peña Nieto and accused him and the electoral institutions of corruption. AMLO’s influential persona in Mexican politics, particularly within MORENA, has fueled a long-standing animosity between his base and the electoral institutions dating back to 2006. This personal antagonism appears to reach a climax with the electoral reforms (Sánchez-Talanquer and Greene 2021).\nIn 2018, AMLO triumphed in the presidential race under his newly formed party, MORENA. By 2023, MORENA controls the presidency, a coalition dominating Congress, and the governorship of states with 68.2% of Mexico’s population (Becerril Romo 2023). AMLO’s ideology, encapsulated in the “fourth transformation” of Mexico, seeks to uplift the marginalized, dismantle corrupt elites, and empower ordinary Mexicans (Fuentes 2018). He contrasts his movement with the established PRIAN (PRI and PAN), branding them the “mafia in power” (Monsiváis-Carrillo 2023). Dissatisfaction after 18 years of PAN and PRI rule fueled support for AMLO’s anti-establishment stance, evident in presidential approval ratings (see Figure 1). Other than AMLO’s personal animosity toward the INE it is evident that his anti-establishment ideology easily fits in the INE, as being part of the corrupted elites that must be cleansed.\nFollowing the lackluster recall referendum in 2022 and amid a period of intense tension between electoral institutions and AMLO, the reforms were called. I will argue that this was not a coincidence. AMLO’s government provided only $77 million USD for the referendum, covering just half of the necessary expenses for election preparations, as noted by election officials (Kahn 2022). Consequently, this led to a turnout of merely 17% of the electorate, far below the 40% required for validity, despite 91.8% support for AMLO (BBC News Mundo 2022). AMLO criticized the INE for incompetence and accused them of “sabotaging” the referendum (Starr 2022).\nDuring the period leading up to the referendum, AMLO displayed illegal propaganda in the form of billboards, tweets, and other materials under the slogan #QueSigaElPresidente. Despite INE denouncements and TEPJF support of their judgment, AMLO persisted in disseminating illegal pro-AMLO propaganda during the plebiscite, displaying defiance (Villanueva Ulfgard 2023). This ongoing conflict underscored the president’s animosity towards institutions that opposed him and contributed to the subsequent push for electoral reforms."

    "section": "(2) Executive Power Centralization",
    "text": "(2) Executive Power Centralization\nThrough the reforms, AMLO has expanded the reach of the Executive branch onto the institutions that are supposed to hold the president accountable. It recalls the PRI hegemonic rule of the 20th century, where Mexico was controlled by one party, the PRI, under the guidance of a one-term president. AMLO’s degradation of horizontal accountability points to this rule, which has only been eliminated since the 2000’s. The IFE was a pivotal institution for democratization and the decentralization of the executive with an institution that could independently secure Mexico’s free and fair elections. The INE stands in the way of AMLO’s hyper-presidential aspirations (Villanueva Ulfgard 2023).\nAMLO is leveraging the current low confidence in institutions and his populist ideology to solidify his executive advantage. There is a notable convergence between the declining confidence in the INE and a growing trust in the president’s ability to make authoritarian decisions (see Figures 2 & 3). For instance, in 2002, only 19.2% of Mexicans supported the idea of the president controlling the media in case of difficulties (LAPOP 2020). However, this figure has steadily risen over the years, reaching an all-time high of 41.7% in 2020 (LAPOP 2020). Conversely, confidence in the INE stood at 52.2% in 2006 but dropped to its lowest point of 33.1% in 2018, the year of AMLO’s election (LAPOP 2020).\nThis convergence of low confidence in the INE and high confidence in executive discretion creates an opportunity for AMLO to mount attacks on the INE. His embrace of populist ideals and reforms ensures higher popular approval. One significant aspect of this appeal to popular approval is his advocacy for a plebiscitary democratic order in Mexico, which was reflected in the proposed reforms. In Plan A, AMLO pushed for direct elections for the functionaries of the electoral organs from a list proposed by each one of the three. political branches. Unlike a purely direct democratic approach, AMLO and his political allies in other branches would act as intermediaries between the election of the functionaries, choosing the candidate list, and calling for these elections. AMLO utilizes the popularity of universal elections of functionaries but secures his power by being one of the powers that offer a list of candidate functionaries for election. His popularity and ability to directly communicate with the people through his mañanera conferences make it easy for him to convince his base to elect the functionaries of his choice (NBC News 2021).\nThe expansion of executive power is further evident in Plan B of the reforms. Plan B seeks to undermine horizontal accountability by compelling the INE to collaborate with executive influences. As detailed in the background, critical responsibilities such as maintaining the electoral registry would be required to involve the executive branch secretariats, in addition to adding limitations to how the INE can use its finances. This increased executive influence over key roles within the INE accompanies a substantial decrease in the INE’s institutional capabilities, notably through significant staff cuts, as illustrated in Table 1.\nThese cuts undermine the INE’s capacity to fulfill one of its primary functions, which is to provide professional electoral services. Simultaneously, by reducing the INE’s power through authority and budget cuts, the reforms create a power vacuum. This vacuum is then expanded upon by the executive branch, which seeks to assert control in the absence of INE’s previously held authority."

    "section": "(3) Continued Party Expansion",
    "text": "(3) Continued Party Expansion\nMORENA is still a young political party that has only been registered since 2014, yet in less than a decade, it has transformed the political landscape in Mexico. Currently, MORENA holds 252 out of 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies (Cámara de Diputados 2021), 59 out of 128 seats in the Senate (Senado de la República n.d.), and 22 out of 32 state gubernatorial offices (Linares 2023). MORENA has expanded its influence to control half of Mexico’s political landscape.\nIn many ways, MORENA capitalized on the unsuccessful outcomes of Mexico’s weak state capacity. This was because the lackluster results led to dissatisfaction with established parties, thus allowing for MORENA’s grand entrance in 2018 (Sánchez-Talanquer and Greene 2021). However, as MORENA grapples with its own challenges related to weak state capacity and confronts obstacles in driving social progress, doubts arise regarding its ability to maintain its political expansion. With only three election cycles in which MORENA has participated, there is a concern about its rapid growth, which could potentially be unsustainable or begin to stagnate if public sentiment towards MORENA sours. The electoral reforms were designed to ensure the party’s continued expansion.\nThe proposed reforms aimed to help this expansion in multiple ways. Firstly, they seeked to leverage the weak state to their advantage. AMLO likely thought that his proposals would not pass, but they present an image of active efforts to dismantle the corrupt establishment and improve the weak state. When the reforms met with resistance from PRIAN, it portrayed the PRIAN as obstacles to progress while positioning AMLO and his party as proponents of progress. Rather than MORENA being weighed down by a lack of institutional capacity AMLO is using it to his advantage.\nSecondly, if the reforms had passed, they would have provided his party an advantage through clauses in the reforms. For example, the Ley General de Comunicación Social in Plan B would have broadened the definition of propaganda, allowing government officials to disseminate information as they deemed fit. This would have provided significant advantages to incumbents in races, particularly benefiting MORENA, which already controls a large part of influential government offices.\nFinally, there are many other parts of the reforms that would implicitly allow for the protection of the party. However, the infamous Cláusula de la Vida Eterna (The Eternal Life Clause) would allow political parties to transfer votes received by the electorate to other parties (Vallejo 2022). MORENA has significant political alliances with smaller parties in its coalition like the Partido de Trabajo and the Partido Verde Ecologista de México. This clause would enable larger parties to artificially sustain small or dying parties for political gain, which could be essential as a way to repay political favors and execute other political maneuvers. The reform was ultimately excluded from the formal reform proposals, but they show the intent with which the reforms were introduced to assist the party politically (Reyes and Laborde 2023)."

    "section": "The CFA as a Framework for Integration?",
    "text": "The CFA as a Framework for Integration?\nTo understand the impact of the CFA franc on integration, it is crucial to comprehend the four different approaches that aim to achieve a more beneficial integration. These approaches involve varying degrees of rejection of the CFA franc. By examining the various approaches, it is possible to observe how the colonial structure of the CFA impacts progress in the development of new integration models.\n\nThe Reformist Path Forward\nAccording to Sylla, the first two approaches to progress are “symbolic reformism” and “adaptive reformism,” which have been the only reforms implemented thus far. “Symbolic reformism” only makes superficial changes to the current system, whereas “adaptive reformism” introduces more substantive changes while still keeping power concentrated in Paris. Both of these approaches prevent an integration model that would be beneficial for Africa. These approaches essentially repackage the French system under the guise of African autonomy. All reforms enacted in the CFA region fall under these categories. The reforms have exemplified how French influence has impeded and continues to impede movements for the integration of Africa that are beneficial to Africa. The current system, which is designed for the benefit of France, only undergoes changes in name and policy with these reforms, but no change is made to the source of the problem, which is French influence.\nFor example, in 1958, as French colonies in Africa gained independence, the French renamed the currency from “Franc of the French Colonies in Africa” to “Franc of the French Community of Africa” (A Brief History Of The CFA Franc, 2012). Additionally, the required amount of foreign reserves that African banks need to deposit has also decreased over time due to the pressure from African nations on France. Furthermore, a recent reform proposal in 2019 consisted of renaming the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) CFA franc to “ECO” and rebrand it under the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The ECOWAS is supported by French President Macron, who is willing to renegotiate terms on the new system.\nThese reforms create a convenient distraction for France by diverting attention from French exploitation of the CFA structure. This complicates the relationship between France and Africa, obscures France’s responsibility for the stagnation of the CFA zone, and allows France to sustain its economy at Africa’s expense. If these reforms alone continue to be implemented, the French CFA zone will continue to obstruct the process of restorative integration for Africa.\n\n\n“Sovereign Abolitionism”\n“Sovereign abolitionism” is the most radical rejection of the CFA franc, as it seeks to abolish the unified currency and return the power of monetary policy to each state. Proponents of ‘sovereign abolitionism’ seek to enhance regional integration by eliminating all aspects of the CFA franc system, including the currency bloc, and establishing trade partnerships that re-envision what integration can mean specifically in Africa. Only “neoliberal abolitionism” and “sovereign abolitionism” advocate for creating the change necessary to advance African interests. However, unlike “neoliberal abolitionism,” “sovereign abolitionism” regards the CFA franc as a hindrance to integration, as it would have to eliminate the entire concept of the CFA. Advocates for “sovereign abolitionism” see the CFA as a distraction to pursuing a new integration model beneficial for Africa.\n\n\n“Neoliberal Abolitionism”\nThe previous three approaches have demonstrated that the CFA’s efforts to maintain the status quo have impeded the development of new integration models. However, the “neoliberal abolitionist” approach proposes that the CFA can serve as a framework for new integration models. “Neoliberal abolitionism” seeks to preserve a monetary union in the region while breaking away from French influence. This view regards the CFA franc as a valuable framework for a new, self-administered, supranational, integrated institution that includes a currency union. Although the CFA franc was imposed by France, which cleared several political hurdles such as a lack of political will and public support, it is crucial to acknowledge its oppressive history. The existing regionalism culture can facilitate a smoother transition towards a currency union. This approach of moving away from the CFA franc could therefore facilitate new forms of integration.\nThe ECOWAS was initially meant to follow through with these reforms, but it has been heavily altered by the French who have transformed it into a change of “symbolic reformism” (Sylla 2022, p.55). If this strategy were to be pursued, it would require careful planning to avoid reproducing the same oppressive policies and institutions as the previous system. Although Francophone Africa does not face a lack of political will for integration, it must confront France’s determination to maintain its dominance in the region, which is the most significant challenge of the “neoliberal abolitionism” approach (this determination will be seen in the next section)."

    "section": "The History of French Intimidation and African Resistance",
    "text": "The History of French Intimidation and African Resistance\nAchieving African economic independence from France remains challenging due to the political history surrounding the CFA zone. To elaborate, France has exerted pressure on African countries to retain the colonial currency. Guinea serves as a well-known example, having chosen not to adopt the currency. When French President de Gaulle visited Guinea before a referendum on whether the country would join the CFA zone, the deputy of the French National Assembly in Guinea famously angered de Gaulle by saying, “We prefer to be poor in freedom than rich in slavery.” Despite de Gaulle’s threats to cut off development aid, Guinea voted overwhelmingly for complete independence. However, France had already extracted all of Guinea’s reserves before the referendum, and after the vote, “ended its budgetary assistance and ceased the pension payments to the 20,000 Guinean veterans who had fought for France. It also unsuccessfully attempted to block Guinea’s entry into the United Nations” (Pigeaud et al., 2020, p.40-3). France utilized all available means to prevent Guinea from seceding, and it has had the added effect of deterring other nations from considering secession in the future.\nFuture leaders who dared to question the CFA franc were reprimanded, as seen in the case of Mali’s attempt to introduce an independent currency. In 1967, neighboring countries in the CFA franc zone limited trade with Mali, which ultimately forced it to return to the CFA zone (Pigeaud et al., 2020, p.47). Similarly, in 1963, Togo’s President Olympio was assassinated after running on a platform to leave the CFA zone; a coup was then orchestrated to bring a French-friendly president to power (p.50). These are just a few examples of French intimidation and sabotage, and there are likely many others that remain undocumented. These tactics of persuasion were likely also used during the negotiations for the new ECOWAS agreement, which is set to take full effect in 2027. Through these means, France has maintained influence in African countries that use the CFA franc."

    "text": "A Realistic Future\nThe French presence in Africa has hindered the development of integration that benefits African people. France will likely continue to impede meaningful integration, using tactics such as “symbolic reformism” and “adaptive reformism” to blur the connection between prosperous France and oppressed CFA Africa. However, influential figures will continue to draw attention to these issues out of concern for African sovereignty. For example, an article in Foreign Policy magazine titled “Macron Isn’t So Post-Colonial After All’’ by Gladstein (2021) criticized the French government’s actions. Some figures have used public appearances to shame France for its actions, such as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who displayed a CFA currency note during a speech criticizing the CFA system (see Figure 5). However, French publication Le Monde responded to Meloni’s remarks with an article titled”Giorgia Meloni’s exaggerations about France’s ‘colonial currency’” (Dagorn, 2022). Prime Minister Meloni is pressuring the French to reform by highlighting the issues of the CFA, even if some may consider it a mere stunt. In response, French advocates of the system have attempted and will continue to divert attention away from those highlighting the issues.\nFigure 5. Prime Minister of Italy Giorgia Meloni Holding a CFA Bill While Addressing French Oppression in Africa  Note. Adapted from “Giorgia Meloni’s exaggerations about France’s ‘colonial currency,’” Le Monde, 2022.\nFacilitated meaningful integration based on the CFA franc using “neoliberal abolitionism” is a possibility. However, the premise that French institutions will facilitate such integration falls apart when faced with resistance from France, which has a vested interest in keeping the CFA in place and the power to act on its will. An alternative route to meaningful integration could be “sovereign abolitionism,” which rejects the CFA approach entirely. Regardless of the approach taken, it will be essential to prioritize the needs and interests of African nations and their people, rather than external actors, to achieve sustainable integration. The fight for meaningful integration in Africa, free from the constraints of colonialism and neocolonialism will require persistent efforts to overcome the obstacles posed by institutions like the CFA franc."

    "text": "The Reformist Path Forward\nAccording to Sylla, the first two approaches to progress are “symbolic reformism” and “adaptive reformism,” which have been the only reforms implemented thus far. “Symbolic reformism” only makes superficial changes to the current system, whereas “adaptive reformism” introduces more substantive changes while still keeping power concentrated in Paris. Both of these approaches prevent an integration model that would be beneficial for Africa. These approaches essentially repackage the French system under the guise of African autonomy. All reforms enacted in the CFA region fall under these categories. The reforms have exemplified how French influence has impeded and continues to impede movements for the integration of Africa that are beneficial to Africa. The current system, which is designed for the benefit of France, only undergoes changes in name and policy with these reforms, but no change is made to the source of the problem, which is French influence.\nFor example, in 1958, as French colonies in Africa gained independence, the French renamed the currency from “Franc of the French Colonies in Africa” to “Franc of the French Community of Africa” (A Brief History Of The CFA Franc, 2012). Additionally, the required amount of foreign reserves that African banks need to deposit has also decreased over time due to the pressure from African nations on France. Furthermore, a recent reform proposal in 2019 consisted of renaming the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) CFA franc to “ECO” and rebrand it under the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The ECOWAS is supported by French President Macron, who is willing to renegotiate terms on the new system.\nThese reforms create a convenient distraction for France by diverting attention from French exploitation of the CFA structure. This complicates the relationship between France and Africa, obscures France’s responsibility for the stagnation of the CFA zone, and allows France to sustain its economy at Africa’s expense. If these reforms alone continue to be implemented, the French CFA zone will continue to obstruct the process of restorative integration for Africa."

    "text": "“Sovereign Abolitionism”\n“Sovereign abolitionism” is the most radical rejection of the CFA franc, as it seeks to abolish the unified currency and return the power of monetary policy to each state. Proponents of ‘sovereign abolitionism’ seek to enhance regional integration by eliminating all aspects of the CFA franc system, including the currency bloc, and establishing trade partnerships that re-envision what integration can mean specifically in Africa. Only “neoliberal abolitionism” and “sovereign abolitionism” advocate for creating the change necessary to advance African interests. However, unlike “neoliberal abolitionism,” “sovereign abolitionism” regards the CFA franc as a hindrance to integration, as it would have to eliminate the entire concept of the CFA. Advocates for “sovereign abolitionism” see the CFA as a distraction to pursuing a new integration model beneficial for Africa."

    "section": "“Neoliberal Abolitionism”",
    "text": "“Neoliberal Abolitionism”\nThe previous three approaches have demonstrated that the CFA’s efforts to maintain the status quo have impeded the development of new integration models. However, the “neoliberal abolitionist” approach proposes that the CFA can serve as a framework for new integration models. “Neoliberal abolitionism” seeks to preserve a monetary union in the region while breaking away from French influence. This view regards the CFA franc as a valuable framework for a new, self-administered, supranational, integrated institution that includes a currency union. Although the CFA franc was imposed by France, which cleared several political hurdles such as a lack of political will and public support, it is crucial to acknowledge its oppressive history. The existing regionalism culture can facilitate a smoother transition towards a currency union. This approach of moving away from the CFA franc could therefore facilitate new forms of integration.\nThe ECOWAS was initially meant to follow through with these reforms, but it has been heavily altered by the French who have transformed it into a change of “symbolic reformism” (Sylla 2022, p.55). If this strategy were to be pursued, it would require careful planning to avoid reproducing the same oppressive policies and institutions as the previous system. Although Francophone Africa does not face a lack of political will for integration, it must confront France’s determination to maintain its dominance in the region, which is the most significant challenge of the “neoliberal abolitionism” approach (this determination will be seen in the next section)."

States seem to be autonomous political actors who make decisions for their clearly demarcated territory. However, this ‘traditional’ Westphalian model of state systems has never truly existed, and its facade is deteriorating. The erosion of the traditional state system is primarily due to globalizing forces, which have complicated the straightforward conception of the state. To understand this erosion, three aspects of globalization must be considered: political influences, institutional influences, and influences from non-state actors."

    "section": "Political Influence",
    "text": "Political Influence\nStates use their power to influence other states, especially those with significant political and economic resources. When power extends beyond borders in decision-making, the Westphalian model of state autonomy is compromised. States may appear to make decisions independently, but they are often influenced in their decision-making process. Political influences manifest prominently in three forms. First, great powers align the political conduct of states in their spheres of influence to their agendas. Second, states use economic wealth to manipulate other states into desired political conduct. Third, states use soft power to push their national ideology onto other states.\nGreat powers use their political influence to control states in their alliances and in their sphere of interest. This international political involvement violates the traditional meaning of Westphalian autonomy. The actions taken by the United States, the US, during the Cold War era are a prime example of how states leveraged their political influence. The US implemented the Marshall Plan, providing $13.3 billion (equivalent to $150 billion when adjusted for inflation) to assist sixteen European states. This was done because the U.S. believed that high levels of poverty in war-torn Europe would “strengthen the appeal of communism and fascism”(National Museum of American Diplomacy, n.d.). To prevent changes in the political leanings of these European partners, the US boosted their economies and brought them into an alliance to deter them from choosing communism. Great powers are competing to shape political ideologies within their jurisdiction of influence. This very competition is eroding the traditional sovereign state.\nStates have also used their economic wealth in a quid quo pro manner, especially through investment, to interfere in other states’ political processes. China’s “Dollar Diplomacy” strategy provides stimulus packages and other investment opportunities for countries in exchange for diplomatic recognition. For example, in 2020 it provided $187 million dollars to Pacific island states in exchange for diplomatic recognition (Chinese Aid to the Pacific, 2023). This illustrates China’s influence in the political affairs of politically weaker states. Global powers exert their influence within their respective spheres of control by interfering in the internal processes of other states, thereby complicating the concept of state autonomy. In a similar vein, Chinese “debt trap” diplomacy involves providing seemingly benevolent loans for the construction of infrastructure projects in the global South. However, when these recipient states become unable to repay these loans, they are compelled to negotiate with the Chinese government (Bradsher, 2022). This negotiation may include ceding territory to the Chinese government, as was the case for a Sri Lankan port in 2018 (Abi-Habib, 2018). In these situations, China has leveraged its economic might to infringe upon the territorial sovereignty of these states, illustrating the erosion of the traditional concept of sovereign statehood.\nThe pervasive influence of soft power, on the other hand, is an indirect tool with clear but unmeasurable effects on state operations. For example, McDonald’s has 38,000 locations in over 100 countries, which influences the regions in which they operate by exporting American culture through food (Franchising Overview, n.d.). McDonald’s is a tool under which the US operates to globally promote pro-American ideals and soft power influence. Another example is how American television is broadcast all over the world and in turn, propagates an American mentality. Through soft power, states and their nationals are psychologically influenced by an American mentality, changing their approach to governance and diplomacy. When states are impacted by this soft power influence, the fully autonomous narrative of the traditional state is threatened."

    "section": "Institutional Influence",
    "text": "Institutional Influence\nThe authority of increasingly powerful international institutions has eroded the traditional Westphalian notion of state systems. International institutions complicate state autonomy in three ways: international institutions gain a unique legitimate authority for intervention, great powers use international bodies to influence other states, and the implementation of regional integration.\nInternational organizations have cultivated a reputation as legitimate global authorities. From a constructivist viewpoint that emphasizes norms, it becomes clear that institutions such as the United Nations (UN) acquire distinctive legitimacy to intervene in humanitarian conflicts when its membership deems it necessary. When there is consensus across states to intervene, it can be assumed that the intervention is just and necessary. The UN can then send peacekeeping missions or commission a specific coalition of states to intervene in a state conflict. However, intervention directly contradicts the Westphalian model of respect for the political process occurring within a state. For example, in 1995, Operation Deliberate Force was a UN-supported NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) bombing of Serbian forces in Yugoslavia (Beale, 1997). UN approval bestowed the mission with a justified humanitarian image that took precedence over considerations of Yugoslavian autonomy. International organizations are increasingly acquiring the legitimate capacity to intervene in state affairs. This development contradicts the Westphalian model’s principle of states maintaining unambiguous autonomous control over their territory.\nThrough international organs, great powers take advantage of the legitimacy of international organizations to project their influence on other states. For instance, the composition of the UN’s Security Council, which features five permanent members with veto power, underscores the continued dominance of states within a vital international organization. It is also important to note that one of the members with veto power, the US, contributes 12.5 billion dollars to the UN (CFR.org Editors, 2023). These great powers shape international organizations to suit their interest and cooperate with them to the extent they desire. These bodies serve as an extension for great powers to exert their influence on the world stage, demonstrating how states are not only limited to their physical territory. Another example of the US using its economic might to influence organizations is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). States fund this institution and have the authority to weigh in on the use of the funds proportionally to their funding. The United States contributes to 17.43% of the IMF’s funds; this contribution, in turn, grants veto power in IMF decision-making (Congressional Research Service, 2022). Through international institutions, the United States and other great powers can mandate policy adoption in other countries in exchange for loans.\nEfforts at regional integration through the establishment of supranational institutions defy both Westphalian criteria of autonomous control and territorial demarcation. For example, regional integration in West Africa in the form of the ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) is attempting to create a single currency, called the ECO in 2027 (West African Regional Bloc Adopts New Plan to Launch Eco Single Currency in 2027, 2021). However, a shared currency will create a supranational governing body that would manage the monetary policy in the states. Supranational organizations, like the ECOWAS, do not fit in the Westphalian model of autonomy because there are numerous organizations with authority in the decision-making of a state. Now focusing on territorial complexities, the European Union (EU) also operates under a supranational system, but they have the principles of freedom of movement with the region (McBride, 2022). This means individuals and commerce can move freely within the region. Territorial divisions are less important in the age of supranational organizations, such as the EU, where there is a concerted effort to facilitate movement across these borders. The simplistic territorial divisions in the Westphalian states no longer apply with the introduction of new models for regional integration."

    "section": "Non-State Influences",
    "text": "Non-State Influences\nPrevious examples have primarily centered on how states and institutions employ political tools to exert influence on the policies of other states. Nonetheless, non-state actors also influence states to the extent that they are no longer autonomously in decision-making but, instead, are subject to external influences. These non-state actors encompass lobbyists and multinational corporations. Lobbyists employ significant sums of money to advocate for and influence policy-making in state institutions, impeding genuine state autonomy. In the US, more than 4.09 billion dollars are used by organizations to lobby the government (Total Lobbying Spending U.S. 2022, 2023). As illustrated in Figure 1, the increasing prevalence of lobbying indicates that states are becoming less autonomous actors and more conduits for external influence. States no longer make autonomous decisions; rather, they serve as vehicles for lobbyists to enact their agencies.\nFigure 1 Total lobbying spending in the United States from 1998 to 2023 (in billion U.S. dollars)  Notes. There has been a consistent rise in US lobbying expenditure (Total Lobbying Spending U.S. 2022, 2023).\nMultinational corporations, especially those based in great powers, have had a strong influence on the political processes of other states. One example of this interference was the banana companies in Central American countries. At its peak, the United Fruit Company owned 42% of Guatemalan land (RS#01: Background on the Guatemalan Coup of 1954, n.d.). The Guatemalan government did not have Westphalian control of this territory, when multinational corporations had such expansive ownership of the land."
