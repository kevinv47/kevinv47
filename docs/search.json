First, a variable representing each character’s name is created, with a value of 1 if that character is mentioned in a line and 0 otherwise. The data is then grouped by episode and season, summarizing the mentions per episode. Next, the data is pivoted to create a variable called character and another variable called count, indicating how many times each character is mentioned. Additionally, a new variable called season_episode is created, which only contains values for the first episode of each season; this will serve as a marker for the start of each season in the ggplot.\n\nmain_4_mentions &lt;- office |&gt; \n  mutate(Jim = ifelse(str_detect(Line, \"(?i)jim\"), 1, 0)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Pam = ifelse(str_detect(Line, \"(?i)pam\"), 1, 0)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Michael = ifelse(str_detect(Line, \"(?i)michael\"), 1, 0)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Dwight = ifelse(str_detect(Line, \"(?i)dwight\"), 1, 0)) |&gt; \n  arrange(Season, Episode_Number) |&gt; \n  group_by(Season, Episode_Number) |&gt; \n  summarize(Jim = sum(Jim),\n            Pam = sum(Pam),\n            Michael = sum(Michael),\n            Dwight = sum(Dwight)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(season_episode_num = row_number()) |&gt; \n  mutate(season_episode = ifelse(Episode_Number == 1, Season, \"\")) |&gt; \n  select(Jim:season_episode) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = Jim:Dwight,\n               names_to = \"character\",\n               values_to = \"count\")\nmain_4_mentions\n\n# A tibble: 736 × 4\n   season_episode_num season_episode character count\n                &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1                  1 \"1\"            Jim           7\n 2                  1 \"1\"            Pam          17\n 3                  1 \"1\"            Michael       7\n 4                  1 \"1\"            Dwight        8\n 5                  2 \"\"             Jim           6\n 6                  2 \"\"             Pam           4\n 7                  2 \"\"             Michael      15\n 8                  2 \"\"             Dwight       10\n 9                  3 \"\"             Jim          17\n10                  3 \"\"             Pam          10\n# ℹ 726 more rows\n\n\nI am identifying the season_episode_num where a new season begins to add vertical lines on the graph, enhancing its visualization.\n\nvline_positions &lt;- main_4_mentions |&gt; \n  filter(season_episode != \"\") |&gt; \n  distinct(season_episode_num) |&gt; \n  pull()\nprint(vline_positions)\n\n[1]   1   7  29  52  65  90 114 138 162"
