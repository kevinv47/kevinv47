## Bio

I'm Kevin, an International Relations major at Pomona College, graduating in May 2026, with a focus on Latin America. Before college, I never imagined myself getting into data science or programming, but after taking a Political Statistics class in R, I discovered my passion for it. Now, I love working with R and am excited to continue developing my skills in Python. I am now interested in pursuing a career in data science.

On this site I keep a list of some of my projects.
