## Bio

I’m Kevin, an International Relations major at Pomona College (class of 2026) with a focus on Latin America. After discovering my passion for data science through a Political Statistics class using R, I’ve been developing my skills in data analysis and programming, particularly in R and Python. I'm excited to apply my growing expertise to data-driven problem solving and explore career opportunities in data science.

On this site I keep a list of some of my projects.
