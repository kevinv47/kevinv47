The chart above shows the MXN peso to USD exchange rate since 1993. Highlighted areas represent periods of peso devaluation relative to the dollar. As the U.S. is Mexico's largest trading partner, this exchange rate is crucial to Mexico's economy and broader economic plans. The orange zones indicate global economic instability, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the red zones highlight devaluations unique to Mexico, which are the focus of this article. This article focuses on the primary economic and political drivers behind the currency devaluation during this period.

In summary this will be a sruvey of the salient factors behind the peso depreciation in the following periods:

- Peso Crisis (1994 - 1996)
- Economic Troubles & Trumpism (2014 - 2016)
- 2024 Elections (June 2024 - Present)

The Mexican Peso Crisis involved a dramatic devaluation of the Mexican peso, which fell from 3 pesos per USD to 6 pesos per USD, effectively losing half its value. Before the crisis, Mexico had attempted to maintain a peg to the USD, allowing the peso to fluctuate within a specific range. However, this seemingly stable peg collapsed in December when the government finally allowed the peso to devalue, triggering a series of economic and political challenges. Below, we will explore some of the most significant political and economic factors during this period.

## Assasinaitons & A Violent Mobilization

Numerous destabilizing events occurred in 1994. I particularly appreciate the title of the El País article, "[México 1994: el año que pasó todo](https://elpais.com/mexico/2024-03-23/mexico-1994-el-ano-que-paso-todo.html)" ("The Year Everything Happened"). For brevity, I will focus on two key political factors that stressed the exchange rate and contributed to the December crisis: high-profile political assassinations and the eruption of the Zapatista movement.

First, to understand the assassinations and their impact, some context is necessary. Mexico's dominant political party, the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party), had controlled the country since the 1930s, effectively creating a one-party system. However, by the 1990s, the PRI’s grip on power was weakening, culminating in the election of the first non-PRI president in 2000. ![](donaldo.jpg)

At the time, sitting presidents selected their successors to run as the PRI’s presidential candidate. Luis Donaldo Colosio, chosen by President Salinas de Gortari, was widely expected to reform the party from within. However, on March 23, Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana, triggering a chaotic scramble to find a replacement just months before the election.

This process was complicated by the Mexican Constitution, which prohibits individuals holding high office within the previous six months from running for president. Despite this, Ernesto Zedillo was selected as the new PRI candidate and later oversaw the peso devaluation in December.

The instability deepened when, on September 28, José Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the PRI’s general secretary—a position wielding significant influence over the party and national politics—was also assassinated.

While neither Colosio nor Ruiz Massieu held active government roles at the time, their positions at the helm of the PRI were crucial. These events shook confidence in a party already under pressure from increasingly competitive smaller parties.

Stable political regimes are essential for fostering predictable economic environments. For decades, the PRI had artificially maintained political stability, but by 1994, this stability was unraveling. The assassinations signaled threats to political order, unsettling markets. Although the PRI sought to reassure markets by swiftly transitioning to a new presidential candidate, this effort added pressure to an already fragile system, setting the stage for the December economic crisis.

Second, it is crucial to note that [NAFTA](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/fr/212651468325813685/pdf/774940JRN020050BLIC00Foreign0Direct.pdf) (the North American Free Trade Agreement) came into effect on January 1, 1994. This agreement brought great optimism about Mexico's economic potential, encouraging investors to view the country as a promising destination for economic activity. This renewed attention increased demand for the peso.

However, on the same day, January 1, 1994, the [Zapatista movement](https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-01-01/and-they-shouted-enough-the-30-year-long-indigenous-uprising-that-rewrote-mexican-history.html) emerged on the national stage. Composed primarily of indigenous militias from Chiapas, the movement opposed the government’s economic liberalization policies, including NAFTA, which they believed marginalized their communities and threatened their traditional way of life. This resistance raised concerns about the stability of Mexico’s economic trajectory.

The Zapatista uprising involved violent confrontations, with over a hundred fatalities in the initial clashes, casting doubt in investors' minds about Mexico’s ability to sustain economic growth without significant disruption. The government faced pressure to crack down on the movement, which it did, but this heavy-handed response underscored the resistance to investor-friendly reforms.

This opposition to economic liberalization, coupled with violence and unrest, created uncertainty about the viability of Mexico's economic policies. It also increased pressure on the peso peg, a cornerstone of the government’s economic strategy, contributing to the strain that ultimately led to the December crisis.

## The Tesobonos and Economic Factors

To understand the Peso Crisis, one key factor is the role of *tesobonos*. These were short-term bonds with a fixed exchange rate, payable in USD. They offered investors the dual benefit of currency stability and higher interest rates than U.S. bonds. By linking returns to USD, the Mexican government aimed to attract foreign investors and inspire confidence amid political instability. At the same time, this strategy aligned with Mexico's economic goals under NAFTA and its push for more open trade policies.

With the peso pegged to the U.S. dollar, it became overvalued over time, making trade more expensive and requiring increasingly large amounts of foreign reserves to maintain the peg. The loss of the peg, or the solution that was eventually used—allowing the peso to float freely against the dollar—was necessary to ease the pressure on imports and the central bank. However, since it was an election year, and with growing political competition, the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) wanted to avoid changing the currency until after the elections. Once Ernesto Zedillo took office, he faced mounting pressure from the peso’s overvaluation and finally allowed the peso to float. This decision, however, led to a sharp depreciation of the peso, as investors panicked and sold off their holdings.

It's important to remember the nature of tesobonos, which were government-issued debt instruments with a fixed exchange rate and were promised to be paid out in U.S. dollars. As the value of the debt exceeded the value of Mexico’s foreign reserves, investors began to worry about Mexico's ability to repay the loans. The graph above illustrates the dramatic decline in the ratio of Mexico’s total reserves to foreign debt. As a result, investors began to offload their Mexican assets, contributing to the peso losing half of its value.

The government needed to allow the peso to depreciate to ease pressure on foreign reserves and make Mexican exports more competitive, which could help address the current account deficit. However, the Zedillo administration could not reassure investors that it could sustain the peso's depreciation due to the structure of tesobonos, whose value could exceed Mexico's foreign reserves, risking default. This loss of investor confidence further devalued the peso and raised doubts about Mexico's ability to meet its obligations.

Between mid-2014 and early 2017, the peso experienced a steady devaluation against the USD, starting at around 13 pesos per US dollar and ending at 20 pesos. This represented a devaluation of 53.9%. Several factors contributed to this decline, both economic, such as fluctuations in gas prices, and political, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the victory of Donald Trump. In this discussion, we will explore some of the key factors behind this devaluation.

Oil prices have been rising dramatically since the turn of the century, as evidenced by OPEC oil prices. The only significant dip occurred during the Great Recession, but prices quickly recovered, reaching new heights in 2012, when the average annual cost of a barrel of oil exceeded \$109. However, just four years later, the price plummeted to less than \$41, resulting in a loss of more than half its value.

What does this mean for Mexico, which has a very large oil and gas sector? The oil industry in Mexico is nationalized by the government and serves as a significant source of government revenue. It meant an unprecedented plummet that would devalue a portion of Mexico's GDP.

In 2014, the oil and gas sector accounted for approximately 5% of GDP, but by 2016, it had fallen to just 2%, primarily due to a dramatic decline in oil prices. This sharp drop significantly impacted federal government revenue, as oil-related income made up [30%](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/mexico-oil-prices-slump) of the federal budget in 2016. Such a decline created ripple effects across the economy, raising concerns among investors about the stability and potential risks of investing in the Mexican economy.

Finally, as seen in GDP during this period, the Mexican economy was in decline, which can help explain the peso's depreciation during this time. The decline of the Mexican economy reflects poorly on investor confidence and could result in fewer investment opportunities, leading to reduced demand for Mexican financial assets. This contributed to the steady depreciation of the peso against the USD that we observed.

### Trump

Entering 2015, a new wave of political tension emerged as Donald Trump’s rhetoric toward Mexico gained traction in the United States. This hostility, coupled with the progressive economic decline leading up to the U.S. elections and Trump's inauguration, heightened investor concerns about the future of Mexican assets. Trump's vocal criticism of NAFTA and calls for its renegotiation added further uncertainty. Until the renegotiation was completed, markets remained unsure of Mexico's economic prospects. [Overall](https://www.france24.com/en/20161109-mexico-usa-peso-plunges-trump-presidential-win), the instability during the early Trump administration exacerbated these challenges, contributing to the depreciation of the peso and increasing economic uncertainty.

The main factor that triggered the depreciation of the peso was the June 2nd general election in Mexico, which saw an increase in violent incidents involving political candidates during regional elections. Additionally, the election resulted in the party MORENA gaining even greater control over the country's governmental institutions.

The graph above shows the results of the Mexican general elections. Maroon represents the coalition dominated by Morena, "Sigamos Haciendo Historia," while orange represents the Movimiento Naranja party, and pink represents Fuerza y Corazón por México, a coalition of institutional parties in Mexico. 

The remarkable achievement of [securing](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-electoral-authority-ratifies-ruling-coalitions-lower-house-supermajority-2024-08-23/) more than two-thirds of the congressional seats means this bloc has the power to amend the constitution without needing cooperation from opposing parties in the Chamber of Deputies and requires only two votes in the Senate. Not to mention MORENA candidate Claudia Sheinbaum becoming the first woman president this year. Controversial reforms, such as those proposed by former President AMLO—like [restructuring](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/electoral-reform-mexico-threat-democracy) the body in charge of elections—and reforms already implemented, such as allowing [judges to be elected](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/g-s1-20967/mexico-judicial-reform-elect-judges-constition-change), are among the proposals seen as threats to democracy. These developments have made [investors wary](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-mexico-election-results/) of Mexican assets.

In the lead-up to the elections, there was also a record-breaking amount of homicides of political candidates, which did not help the appearance of stability in Mexican democracy. This, along with the dominance that MORENA has secured at the federal level, caused concern among investors about the future of democracy in Mexico.

Finally, there are also the 2024 U.S. presidential elections, which saw the victory of Republicans gaining a majority in the House and the Senate, with Donald Trump as president. The peso is not likely to respond well to this in the coming weeks, and we are only beginning to see some of the rhetoric that may affect the value of Mexican assets, potentially depreciating the peso. President-elect Donald Trump, for example, has said that he wants to add a 25% tariff on Mexican imports, to which President Claudia Sheinbaum said, ['For every tariff, there will be a response in kind.'](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/26/congress/trump-tariffs-mexico-00191702)

The duration of the current depreciation of the peso remains uncertain, as the Trump administration won't begin implementing its policies for several months. In the meantime, the policies that MORENA adopts in the coming months will likely also have a significant impact on reassuring investors that democracy is not at risk in Mexico.
