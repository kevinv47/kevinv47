The chart above shows the MXN peso to USD exchange rate since 1993. Highlighted areas represent periods of peso devaluation relative to the dollar. As the U.S. is Mexico's largest trading partner, this exchange rate is crucial to Mexico's economy and broader economic plans. The orange zones indicate global economic instability, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the red zones highlight devaluations unique to Mexico, which are the focus of this article.

The Mexican Peso Crisis involved a dramatic devaluation of the Mexican peso, which fell from 3 pesos per USD to 6 pesos per USD, effectively losing half its value. Before the crisis, Mexico had attempted to maintain a peg to the USD, allowing the peso to fluctuate within a specific range. However, this seemingly stable peg collapsed in December when the government finally allowed the peso to devalue, triggering a series of economic and political challenges. Below, we will explore some of the most significant political and economic factors during this period.

### Assasinaitons & A Violent Mobilization

Numerous destabilizing events occurred in 1994. I particularly appreciate the title of the El País article, "[México 1994: el año que pasó todo](https://elpais.com/mexico/2024-03-23/mexico-1994-el-ano-que-paso-todo.html)" ("The Year Everything Happened"). For brevity, I will focus on two key political factors that stressed the exchange rate and contributed to the December crisis: high-profile political assassinations and the eruption of the Zapatista movement.

First, to understand the assassinations and their impact, some context is necessary. Mexico's dominant political party, the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party), had controlled the country since the 1930s, effectively creating a one-party system. However, by the 1990s, the PRI’s grip on power was weakening, culminating in the election of the first non-PRI president in 2000. ![](donaldo.jpg)

At the time, sitting presidents selected their successors to run as the PRI’s presidential candidate. Luis Donaldo Colosio, chosen by President Salinas de Gortari, was widely expected to reform the party from within. However, on March 23, Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana, triggering a chaotic scramble to find a replacement just months before the election.

This process was complicated by the Mexican Constitution, which prohibits individuals holding high office within the previous six months from running for president. Despite this, Ernesto Zedillo was selected as the new PRI candidate and later oversaw the peso devaluation in December.

The instability deepened when, on September 28, José Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the PRI’s general secretary—a position wielding significant influence over the party and national politics—was also assassinated.

While neither Colosio nor Ruiz Massieu held active government roles at the time, their positions at the helm of the PRI were crucial. These events shook confidence in a party already under pressure from increasingly competitive smaller parties.

Stable political regimes are essential for fostering predictable economic environments. For decades, the PRI had artificially maintained political stability, but by 1994, this stability was unraveling. The assassinations signaled threats to political order, unsettling markets. Although the PRI sought to reassure markets by swiftly transitioning to a new presidential candidate, this effort added pressure to an already fragile system, setting the stage for the December economic crisis.

Second, it is crucial to note that [NAFTA](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/fr/212651468325813685/pdf/774940JRN020050BLIC00Foreign0Direct.pdf) (the North American Free Trade Agreement) came into effect on January 1, 1994. This agreement brought great optimism about Mexico's economic potential, encouraging investors to view the country as a promising destination for economic activity. This renewed attention increased demand for the peso.

However, on the same day, January 1, 1994, the [Zapatista movement](https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-01-01/and-they-shouted-enough-the-30-year-long-indigenous-uprising-that-rewrote-mexican-history.html) emerged on the national stage. Composed primarily of indigenous militias from Chiapas, the movement opposed the government’s economic liberalization policies, including NAFTA, which they believed marginalized their communities and threatened their traditional way of life. This resistance raised concerns about the stability of Mexico’s economic trajectory.

The Zapatista uprising involved violent confrontations, with over a hundred fatalities in the initial clashes, casting doubt in investors' minds about Mexico’s ability to sustain economic growth without significant disruption. The government faced pressure to crack down on the movement, which it did, but this heavy-handed response underscored the resistance to investor-friendly reforms.

This opposition to economic liberalization, coupled with violence and unrest, created uncertainty about the viability of Mexico's economic policies. It also increased pressure on the peso peg, a cornerstone of the government’s economic strategy, contributing to the strain that ultimately led to the December crisis.

### The Tesobonos and Economic Factors

To understand the Peso Crisis, one key factor is the role of *tesobonos*. These were short-term bonds with a fixed exchange rate, payable in USD. They offered investors the dual benefit of currency stability and higher interest rates than U.S. bonds. By linking returns to USD, the Mexican government aimed to attract foreign investors and inspire confidence amid political instability. At the same time, this strategy aligned with Mexico's economic goals under NAFTA and its push for more open trade policies.

With the peso pegged to the U.S. dollar, it became overvalued over time, making trade more expensive and requiring increasingly large amounts of foreign reserves to maintain the peg. The loss of the peg, or the solution that was eventually used—allowing the peso to float freely against the dollar—was necessary to ease the pressure on imports and the central bank. However, since it was an election year, and with growing political competition, the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) wanted to avoid changing the currency until after the elections. Once Ernesto Zedillo took office, he faced mounting pressure from the peso’s overvaluation and finally allowed the peso to float. This decision, however, led to a sharp depreciation of the peso, as investors panicked and sold off their holdings.

It's important to remember the nature of tesobonos, which were government-issued debt instruments with a fixed exchange rate and were promised to be paid out in U.S. dollars. As the value of the debt exceeded the value of Mexico’s foreign reserves, investors began to worry about Mexico's ability to repay the loans. The graph above illustrates the dramatic decline in the ratio of Mexico’s total reserves to foreign debt. As a result, investors began to offload their Mexican assets, contributing to the peso losing half of its value.

The government needed to allow the peso to depreciate to ease pressure on foreign reserves and make Mexican exports more competitive, which could help address the current account deficit. However, the Zedillo administration could not reassure investors that it could sustain the peso's depreciation due to the structure of tesobonos, whose value could exceed Mexico's foreign reserves, risking default. This loss of investor confidence further devalued the peso and raised doubts about Mexico's ability to meet its obligations.
